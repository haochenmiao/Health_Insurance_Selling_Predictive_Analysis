## Explorative Data Analysis (EDA)
This section covers extensive exploratory analysis, including:

* Identifying Null Values
* Analyzing Data Types
* Statistical Description
* Analyzing Response Class Distribution
* Identifying and Eliminating Duplicate Records
* Various Visualizations (Gender, Vehicle Damage, etc.)

## Data Preparation and Transformation
* Feature Selection
* Encoding Categorical Features
* Reviewing Data Types in Processed Dataset
* Exploring Correlation between Features

## Model Training and Evaluation
The project explores several machine learning models:

* Decision Tree Model
* Extra Trees Classifier Model
* Gaussian Naive Bayes Model
* Linear Discriminant Analysis Model
* Random Forest Classifier Model
* Performance Evaluation on Validation Data

## Installation
To set up this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Imblearn
You can install these packages using pip:

`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imblearn`
